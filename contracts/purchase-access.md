# Contract: Purchase → Access

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Provider | Access (`cowork-booking-access`), port 8003 |
| Consumer | Purchase (`cowork-booking-purchase`), through `access_client.py` only |
| Other users | The Member's browser (e-ticket `/t/<ticket_token>`); Staff (kiosk `/checkin`); the e2e suite and contract tests (GET /grants) |
| State | proposed (M2 draft). Becomes agreed at M4 sign-off (tag `contract-v1`), verified by the M6 e2e run |
| OpenAPI | [openapi/access.yaml](openapi/access.yaml) |
| Decisions | D2, D6, D17, D18, D19, D20, D21, D22, D27, D28; ADR-0004, ADR-0008, ADR-0010, ADR-0014, ADR-0017, ADR-0019 |

## 1. Purpose and parties

Purchase asks Access to "Issue an authorised grant" ([extraction site]). Access owns grants, their issuance, the ticket code, the e-ticket and the check-in kiosk.

- **Access does:** store one grant per booking reference, issue its ticket code once and reuse it, show the e-ticket, check codes at the kiosk, revoke on request (AXS-R01, AXS-R05, AXS-R13, AXS-R17).
- **Access never:** calls Purchase, Payment or a lock, knows a price, a coverage or a refund, or computes a check-in window (AXS-R04, AXS-R03).
- **Purchase does:** request the grant when a booking becomes confirmed (PUR-R26), send the window (PUR-R27), and revoke it as step 2 of a cancel (PUR-R32).
- **The lock is mocked.** A stored grant, a `checked_in` state or an ok scan is not proof that a door opened. "Payment success ≠ access provisioned ≠ a successful door opening." ([contexts site]; ADR-0017, AXS-R16).

## 2. Base URLs and authentication

| Setting | Example | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `ACCESS_INTERNAL_URL` (Purchase env) | `http://access:8000` | Purchase, for every API call |
| `PUBLIC_URL` (Access env) | `http://localhost:8003` | Access, to build `ticket_url` |
| `ACCESS_PUBLIC_URL` (Purchase env) | `http://localhost:8003` | Purchase, for links it prints itself |

Authentication (ADR-0019):

- **API** (`/grants*`): send `Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_API_TOKEN>`. A missing token, a wrong token or another scheme gets 401 before any validation or lookup, and nothing changes (AXS-R04). Access compares in constant time and refuses to start when `ACCESS_API_TOKEN` is unset or empty.
- **E-ticket** (`/t/<ticket_token>`): no login and no token. The 128-bit ticket token is a view-only bearer link (AXS-R09, ADR-0008).
- **Kiosk** (`/checkin`): HTTP Basic, user `staff`, password `STAFF_PASSWORD`. Access checks only the password (AXS-R11).
- `/health` and `/_test/clock` need no credentials.

## 3. Conventions

- JSON in and out, `Content-Type: application/json`.
- Times: ISO 8601 with an offset. Access stores the instants as sent and answers in Bangkok time, `+07:00` (D2).
- IDs: grant `gr_` + 22 characters (D22). Ticket code: 8 symbols from `23456789ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTVWXYZ`, stored without the hyphen, returned and shown `XXXX-XXXX`, never starting with `BK` (AXS-R06).
- Unknown request fields are ignored. Consumers ignore unknown response fields.
- Errors always have this shape. The rule rows quote only the text, which is `error.message`. Only `GET /health` keeps the seed shape, `{"status": "error", "error": "database unreachable"}` (section 4.7):

```json
{"error": {"code": "invalid_request", "message": "valid_from needs a UTC offset"}}
```

| Status | error.code | When | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| 400 | `invalid_request` | A field is missing, has the wrong format or is out of range. The message names the field. The path's booking reference is checked too | AXS-R03 |
| 401 | `unauthorized` | No token, a wrong token, or the wrong scheme | AXS-R04 |
| 404 | `not_found` | GET of a reference with no grant and no tombstone, message "grant not found" | AXS-R02 |

## 4. Operations

### 4.1 Grant object

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `grant_id` | string | `gr_` + 22 characters |
| `booking_reference` | string | As sent, e.g. `BK-7KQ2M9` |
| `status` | string | Stored state: `issued`, `checked_in` or `revoked` (AXS-R16) |
| `condition` | string or null | Derived on read: `not_yet_valid`, `expired`, `no_show`, or null. Always null for a revoked grant. Never stored. Purchase ignores it (AXS-R16) |
| `ticket_code` | string or null | `H7K3-9QXA`. Null for a tombstone |
| `ticket_url` | string or null | Access `PUBLIC_URL` + `/t/<ticket_token>`. Null for a tombstone |
| `space_id` | integer or null | As sent. Null for a tombstone |
| `space_name` | string or null | As sent. Null for a tombstone |
| `valid_from`, `valid_until` | string or null | The check-in window [valid_from, valid_until), as sent. Null for a tombstone |
| `revoked_at` | string or null | When the first revoke landed |

The API never returns `member_ref`, and the e-ticket never shows it (AXS-R09).

### 4.2 POST /grants

Issue the grant for one confirmed booking. Purchase calls it when the booking becomes confirmed, and only while it stays confirmed with no cancel in progress (PUR-R26, D20). Plan, free and paid bookings get the same call.

Request:

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `booking_reference` | string | yes | `^BK-[23456789ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTVWXYZ]{6}$` | AXS-R03 |
| `member_ref` | string | yes | Non-empty. Purchase sends the Member's id as text, never the email (PUR-R26) | AXS-R03 |
| `space_id` | integer | yes | 1 to 2147483647 | AXS-R03 |
| `space_name` | string | yes | Non-empty, e.g. `Meeting Room A` | AXS-R03 |
| `valid_from` | string | yes | ISO 8601 with an offset. Purchase sends the booking start (PUR-R27) | AXS-R03 |
| `valid_until` | string | yes | ISO 8601 with an offset, after `valid_from`. Purchase sends the booking end | AXS-R03 |

Access stores the window exactly as sent. It never checks it against opening hours, blocks or buffers (AXS-R03).

Responses:

| Status | Body | When |
|---|---|---|
| 201 | Grant object, `status` issued | No grant and no tombstone for the reference. One grant, one ticket code, one ticket token stored |
| 200 | The stored grant, unchanged | Repeat: a grant exists. The body is ignored, even if it differs (AXS-R01) |
| 200 | Grant object, `status` revoked | The reference has a revoked grant or a tombstone. Nothing is issued (AXS-R02) |
| 400 | Error `invalid_request` | A field is invalid. Nothing stored |
| 401 | Error `unauthorized` | Token check fails. Checked first |

Two identical POSTs at the same instant store one grant. Both answers carry the same `grant_id` and code (UNIQUE `booking_reference`, insert that returns the existing row on conflict).

Idempotency: natural key `booking_reference` (ADR-0014). No Idempotency-Key header.

Implements: AXS-R01, AXS-R02, AXS-R03, AXS-R04, AXS-R05, AXS-R06. Consumer side: PUR-R20, PUR-R26, PUR-R27.

### 4.3 GET /grants/{booking_reference}

Read one grant. Purchase does not call it in v1 (PUR-R26). Contract tests and the e2e suite use it.

| Status | Body | When |
|---|---|---|
| 200 | Grant object with `condition` | A grant or a tombstone exists (a tombstone is 200 with `status` revoked, never 404) |
| 400 | Error `invalid_request` | The path is not `BK-` + 6 symbols |
| 401 | Error `unauthorized` | Token check fails |
| 404 | Error `not_found` | No grant and no tombstone |

Implements: AXS-R02, AXS-R04, AXS-R05, AXS-R08, AXS-R16.

### 4.4 POST /grants/{booking_reference}/revoke

Stop the ticket code from opening. Purchase calls it as step 2 of a confirmed-booking cancel, after step 1 commits (PUR-R32, D19). No request body.

| Status | Body | When |
|---|---|---|
| 200 | Grant object, `status` revoked | The grant was issued or checked_in. It is now revoked |
| 200 | The same grant object, `revoked_at` unchanged | Repeat: already revoked. Nothing changes |
| 200 | Tombstone: `status` revoked, `ticket_code` and `ticket_url` null | No grant yet. A tombstone is stored so that a later POST /grants issues nothing (AXS-R02) |
| 400 | Error `invalid_request` | The path is not `BK-` + 6 symbols |
| 401 | Error `unauthorized` | Token check fails |

Revoke changes nothing outside Access. "The booking and successful payment remain recorded. No automatic refund is implied." ([contexts site]; AXS-R17). The refund is between Purchase and Payment.

Idempotency: natural key `booking_reference`. `revoked` is final.

Implements: AXS-R02, AXS-R04, AXS-R16, AXS-R17. Consumer side: PUR-R31, PUR-R32.

### 4.5 GET /t/{ticket_token} (browser)

The e-ticket. Purchase shows the "View e-ticket" link only to the owner or an operator (PUR-R05); the link itself is a bearer link (D17).

| Case | Status | Page |
|---|---|---|
| Known token | 200 | Space name, date and time in Bangkok, "Check-in 09:00-10:30", a status badge, the code `H7K3-9QXA` in large text with its QR (inline SVG from segno, ADR-0010), and "Booking ref (not for entry) BK-7KQ2M9" in small type. No email, no `member_ref`, no form |
| Revoked grant | 200 | Badge Cancelled and a CANCELLED overlay over the code and QR |
| Unknown token | 404 | No hint whether any ticket exists |

The badge follows the stored state and the clock: Issued, Checked in, Expired (now at or after `valid_until`) or Cancelled. The page never shows a code from the URL. It sends `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` and prints on one page.

Implements: AXS-R05, AXS-R07, AXS-R08, AXS-R09, AXS-R10.

### 4.6 GET and POST /checkin (Staff)

HTTP Basic, user `staff`. Without the right password: 401 with a Basic challenge, and nothing is logged.

- `GET /checkin`: the room list (from `space_id` and `space_name` in stored grants, tombstones excluded), the selected room, an autofocused code input, the last result, and the last 10 scans at that room with codes masked (`••••-9QXA`).
- `POST /checkin` with form field `space_id` and no `code`: select the room. Access stores it in the `access_session` cookie. 303 to `/checkin`.
- `POST /checkin` with form field `code`: scan at the room in `access_session`. A `space_id` in the same POST is ignored: only a POST without `code` selects the room (AXS-R11). So a cross-site form, which arrives without the SameSite=Lax cookie, has no room and is refused even when it sends a `space_id` (AXS-R18). 303 to `/checkin`, where the result shows once (flashed, never in a query string).
- A scan is therefore two POSTs: first `space_id=1` (select), then `code=H7K3-9QXA` (scan) with the same cookie. The e2e suite does the same.
- A scan with no room selected: 303 to `/checkin` with the flash "Select the room first". No scan stored.

The kiosk upper-cases the input and strips spaces and hyphens, then decides in this order (AXS-R12, AXS-R14, AXS-R13):

| Order | Result | Reason text |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `unknown_code` | "Code not recognised". Also for a booking reference (BK7KQ2M9) or a ticket token |
| 2 | `revoked` | "This ticket was cancelled" |
| 3 | `wrong_room` | "This ticket is for Meeting Room A" |
| 4 | `not_open_yet` | "opens 09:00" (or "opens 2026-10-07 09:00" on another date) |
| 4 | `closed` | "Check-in closed at 10:30" |
| 4 | `ok` | "Door unlocked (mock)". Re-entry inside the window is ok again |

Every scan is stored with the time, room, normalised input, result and matched grant (AXS-R15). The first ok scan sets the grant `checked_in` (AXS-R16).

Implements: AXS-R11, AXS-R12, AXS-R13, AXS-R14, AXS-R15, AXS-R16, AXS-R18.

### 4.7 GET /health and POST /_test/clock

- `GET /health`: 200 `{"status": "ok", "revision": "<APP_REVISION>"}`; 503 `{"status": "error", "error": "database unreachable"}`.
- `POST /_test/clock` `{"now": "2026-10-07T09:00:00+07:00"}` or `{"now": null}`: 200 `{"now": ...}` only when `TEST_CLOCK_ENABLED` is exactly `true`. Otherwise 404 and nothing stored (AXS-R19, D27, ADR-0013).

## 5. Examples

Standard data: BK-7KQ2M9 (Member A, Meeting Room A, space_id 1, 2026-10-07 09:00-10:30) is confirmed at 2026-10-05 10:05. Every API request carries `Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_API_TOKEN>`.

### 5.1 Success

```http
POST /grants
Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_API_TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json

{"booking_reference": "BK-7KQ2M9", "member_ref": "17", "space_id": 1,
 "space_name": "Meeting Room A",
 "valid_from": "2026-10-07T09:00:00+07:00", "valid_until": "2026-10-07T10:30:00+07:00"}
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created

{"grant_id": "gr_8Fv2Lq9Xk3Tw7Mz1Rb5Nc4", "booking_reference": "BK-7KQ2M9", "status": "issued",
 "condition": "not_yet_valid", "ticket_code": "H7K3-9QXA",
 "ticket_url": "http://localhost:8003/t/q3Vt9XbLk2Rm8PzW4nHc7A",
 "space_id": 1, "space_name": "Meeting Room A",
 "valid_from": "2026-10-07T09:00:00+07:00", "valid_until": "2026-10-07T10:30:00+07:00",
 "revoked_at": null}
```

Purchase stores `grant_id`, `ticket_url` and `grant_status` issued. The booking page links "View e-ticket" (PUR-R26).

Revoke after Member A cancels at 2026-10-05 11:00 (PUR-R32 step 2):

```http
POST /grants/BK-7KQ2M9/revoke
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{"grant_id": "gr_8Fv2Lq9Xk3Tw7Mz1Rb5Nc4", "booking_reference": "BK-7KQ2M9", "status": "revoked",
 "condition": null, "ticket_code": "H7K3-9QXA",
 "ticket_url": "http://localhost:8003/t/q3Vt9XbLk2Rm8PzW4nHc7A",
 "space_id": 1, "space_name": "Meeting Room A",
 "valid_from": "2026-10-07T09:00:00+07:00", "valid_until": "2026-10-07T10:30:00+07:00",
 "revoked_at": "2026-10-05T11:00:00+07:00"}
```

Check-in at 2026-10-07 09:00, Staff at Meeting Room A, grant issued: `POST /checkin` with `code=H7K3-9QXA`, then 303 to `/checkin`, which shows `data-result="ok"` and "Door unlocked (mock)" (AXS-R13).

### 5.2 Invalid input

A window without an offset (AXS-R03, D2):

```http
POST /grants

{"booking_reference": "BK-7KQ2M9", "member_ref": "17", "space_id": 1,
 "space_name": "Meeting Room A",
 "valid_from": "2026-10-07T09:00:00", "valid_until": "2026-10-07T10:30:00+07:00"}
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request

{"error": {"code": "invalid_request", "message": "valid_from needs a UTC offset"}}
```

Other 400 messages: `"valid_until must be after valid_from"` (equal instants), `"booking_reference must be BK- and 6 symbols"` (`7KQ2M9`), `"space_name is required"`, `"space_id is out of range"` (2147483648). Nothing is stored.

No token (AXS-R04). The token is checked before the body:

```http
POST /grants/BK-7KQ2M9/revoke
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized

{"error": {"code": "unauthorized", "message": "unauthorized"}}
```

The grant stays issued.

### 5.3 Failure

Access does not answer within 5 s during issuance. Purchase keeps the booking confirmed and stores `grant_status` pending. `GET /api/bookings/BK-7KQ2M9` on Purchase then shows `"status": "confirmed", "grant_status": "pending", "ticket_url": null`, and the booking page says "Your e-ticket is being prepared" (PUR-R26). The next booking page open or the Operator's Retry resends the same POST /grants.

The revoke gets no answer. Purchase stores `grant_status` revoke_pending, shows "Revocation pending" and "Refund pending", and sends no refund yet (PUR-R32, PUR-Q10). Until the revoke lands, the old code still opens (PUR-Q12).

A late issuance retry meets a tombstone. BK-P4W6RC was revoked before any grant existed (AXS-R02):

```http
POST /grants

{"booking_reference": "BK-P4W6RC", "member_ref": "17", "space_id": 2,
 "space_name": "Focus Pod 1",
 "valid_from": "2026-10-05T13:00:00+07:00", "valid_until": "2026-10-05T13:30:00+07:00"}
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{"grant_id": "gr_4Hs9Pd2Wm6Qx8Kn3Tf7Lz1", "booking_reference": "BK-P4W6RC", "status": "revoked",
 "condition": null, "ticket_code": null, "ticket_url": null,
 "space_id": null, "space_name": null, "valid_from": null, "valid_until": null,
 "revoked_at": "2026-10-05T10:05:00+07:00"}
```

Purchase stores `grant_status` revoked and shows no e-ticket link (PUR-R26 row 6).

Kiosk refusals (AXS-R14): a revoked grant scanned anywhere gives `data-result="revoked"`; the right code at Board Room gives `wrong_room`; the booking reference `BK-7KQ2M9` gives `unknown_code`; H7K3-9QXA at 08:59 gives `not_open_yet` (opens 09:00); at 10:30 it gives `closed`.

### 5.4 Repeat

Purchase's first POST /grants timed out after Access stored the grant. Purchase resends the same body (AXS-R01, AXS-R05):

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{"grant_id": "gr_8Fv2Lq9Xk3Tw7Mz1Rb5Nc4", "booking_reference": "BK-7KQ2M9", "status": "issued",
 "condition": "not_yet_valid", "ticket_code": "H7K3-9QXA",
 "ticket_url": "http://localhost:8003/t/q3Vt9XbLk2Rm8PzW4nHc7A",
 "space_id": 1, "space_name": "Meeting Room A",
 "valid_from": "2026-10-07T09:00:00+07:00", "valid_until": "2026-10-07T10:30:00+07:00",
 "revoked_at": null}
```

The same `grant_id`, the same code, still one grant. A repeat with another window (10:00-11:30) gets the same 200 with the stored 09:00-10:30 window: a repeat never updates or re-issues.

A repeated revoke returns 200 with `status` revoked and `revoked_at` still `2026-10-05T11:00:00+07:00` (AXS-R17).

### 5.5 Coverage skips collection

**No call is made to Payment.** Member B (plan_active true) books Meeting Room A 2026-10-07 10:30-11:30 as BK-3MZ8QT. Purchase confirms it at once with coverage `plan` (PUR-R19, PUR-R20). The only outbound call is the same POST /grants a paid booking gets:

```http
POST /grants

{"booking_reference": "BK-3MZ8QT", "member_ref": "18", "space_id": 1,
 "space_name": "Meeting Room A",
 "valid_from": "2026-10-07T10:30:00+07:00", "valid_until": "2026-10-07T11:30:00+07:00"}
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created

{"grant_id": "gr_6Wc3Nv8Jt2Xq5Pb9Hm4Rd7", "booking_reference": "BK-3MZ8QT", "status": "issued",
 "condition": "not_yet_valid", "ticket_code": "M4TR-8WCE",
 "ticket_url": "http://localhost:8003/t/Zk7Pq2Wn9Tb4Xm6Rc3Lv8H",
 "space_id": 1, "space_name": "Meeting Room A",
 "valid_from": "2026-10-07T10:30:00+07:00", "valid_until": "2026-10-07T11:30:00+07:00",
 "revoked_at": null}
```

The request carries no price, amount or coverage, and Access does not ask for one (AXS-R01 row 5). On cancel, Purchase revokes the grant and makes no Payment call (PUR-R30).

## 6. How Purchase applies each answer

| Purchase call | Answer | Purchase does | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST /grants | 201 or 200 issued or checked_in | Store `grant_id`, `ticket_url`, `grant_status` issued | PUR-R26 |
| POST /grants | 200 revoked | Store `grant_status` revoked. No e-ticket link | PUR-R26 |
| POST /grants | No answer or 5xx | `grant_status` pending, "being prepared". Retry on the booking page or the Operator's Retry | PUR-R26 |
| revoke | 200 revoked | `grant_status` revoked. Then the refund step may run | PUR-R32 |
| revoke | No answer or 5xx | `grant_status` revoke_pending, "revocation pending". The refund waits | PUR-R32, PUR-Q10 |

Purchase never stores `checked_in` or a no-show: `grant_status` is Purchase's own record of what it asked for (PUR-T34).

## 7. Timeouts and retries

- Every call uses `timeout=5` seconds (D28, PUR-R35).
- A timeout, a connection error or a 5xx answer means "unreachable". Purchase stores no result for it and marks the step pending.
- Purchase never calls Access while a database transaction is open. For a cancel, step 1 commits first; then Purchase revokes (PUR-R32, PUR-R35).
- Purchase makes one attempt per call inside a request, with no loop or sleep. It retries on the next touch: booking page open or the Operator's Retry. Revoke first, then the refund (PUR-R32).
- Purchase never retries POST /grants for a booking that is cancelled or has a cancel in progress (PUR-R26).
- Retries are safe: POST /grants and revoke are idempotent on `booking_reference` (ADR-0014), and a revoke that lands before an issue leaves a tombstone (AXS-R02).
- Any other 4xx (400, 401) is a defect in Purchase or its config. Purchase logs the operation, the booking reference and the status (never the token), stores nothing and treats the step as pending.
- Access never retries anything and never calls back (AXS-R04, ADR-0004).

## 8. Test-observable page markers

| Page | Marker | Values |
|---|---|---|
| GET `/t/<ticket_token>` | element `data-ticket-code="H7K3-9QXA"` holding the large code | The code as shown, `XXXX-XXXX` |
| GET `/t/<ticket_token>` | element `data-status="issued"` on the badge | The stored state: `issued`, `checked_in` or `revoked`. The badge text may say Expired; `data-status` stays the stored state |
| GET `/checkin` after a scan | element `data-result="ok"` with the reason text | `ok`, `not_open_yet`, `closed`, `revoked`, `wrong_room`, `unknown_code` |

## 9. Versioning

- This draft is state proposed. At M4 a consumer-lens reviewer signs it off in `REVIEW_LOG.md`; then `cowork-booking-access` is tagged `contract-v1`, and this text moves to `cowork-booking-access/CONTRACT.md` with `openapi.yaml` (ADR-0005).
- Any change after `contract-v1`, even an added response field, goes through a CONTRACT_CHANGE_REQUEST and the tag `contract-v2`.
- The paths carry no version prefix. Consumers ignore response fields they do not know.
